<p>The Web of Things Working Group has published Web of Things (WoT) Architecture and Web of Things (WoT) Thing Description as W3C Recommendations, thus enabling easy integration across Internet of Things platforms and applications. The WoT Architecture specification describes the abstract architecture for the W3C Web of Things, while the WoT Thing Description describes the metadata and interfaces of Things, where a Thing is an abstraction of a physical or virtual entity that provides interactions to and participates in the Web of Things.These solutions are already deployed in products today. The Web of Things is applicable to multiple IoT domains, including Smart Home, Industrial, Smart City, Retail, and Health applications, where usage of the W3C WoT standards can simplify the development of IoT systems that combine devices from multiple vendors and ecosystems. Please read more in our Press Release.
